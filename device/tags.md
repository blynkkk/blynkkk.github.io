# Tags

Tags ****can be used to give a short note to selected unit. They can be applied to **Users** and **Devices** now.  
  
**Tags management panel** is located in Setting - Organization Settings - Tags

![Tags management panel](../.gitbook/assets/tags-management.png)

  
Here you can create Tags with length _up to 24 characters \(only letters, digits, and spaces\)_ and pick the colors, edit and remove them.

There's an option to **create new tag on-the-go** in User or Device view:  
- click tag icon  
- start typing it's name  
- press enter or "Create new tag: %tag\_name%"   
_**Note:**_  the only downside of this method is no color selection.
