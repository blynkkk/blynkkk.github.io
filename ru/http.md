# HTTP RESTful API
Blynk HTTP RESTful API allows to easily read and write values of Pins in Blynk apps and Hardware.  
API description can be found [here](http://docs.blynkapi.apiary.io).
**Warning**: Blynk HTTP API still has GEO DNS issue. This means, for now you need to use direct server IP instead of
hostname in order to make it work with 3-d party services like IFTTT.
