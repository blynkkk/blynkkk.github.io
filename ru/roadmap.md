# Roadmap

We build Blynk based on Blynkers feedback but with limited resources we have to prioritize our features. At the moment list look like that:

* App Sharing \(project sharing when other people can control your hardware, but can't modify your project\); Free Beta
* App Sharing \(project sharing when other people can control your hardware, but can't modify your project\); Subscription based
* Bluetooth Low Energy support;
* Hardware state handling \(changing physical button state changes Blynk application state\);
* Hardware online/offlane state improvements \(better indication for "is hardware online?", "is hardware offline?"\);
* Project space increase
* Direct Connect support \(for WiFi\);
* RTC widget;
* Design options for widgets \(size, button with icons, etc\);
* Phone sensors widgets \(GPS, accelerometer\);
* IP camera support;
* Customizable look and feel of the project

Under consideration:

* Home screen widget \(to avoid opening App when you need only 1 button click\);
* Haptic feedback \(vibration\) when touching widgets
