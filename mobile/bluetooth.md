### Bluetooth

Widget for enabling Bluetooth support. At the moment Bluetooth widget supported only for Android and requires 
internet connection in order to login and load your profile. However this will be fixed soon. Also some Blynk 
widgets not allowed with Bluetooth.
                                                                                              
Blynk currently support bunch of different modules. Please check sketches below.
