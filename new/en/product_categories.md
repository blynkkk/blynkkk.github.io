### Info: Categories

Use this option to group devices by their type on voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant) side.
It allows you to control the entire group of devices by giving single commands. 

#### Examples: 
1. voice command "Alexa, lights on" turns on all the bulbs in the room – you don't have to repeat the command for each of them;  
2. voice command "Alexa, play the music" starts playing the music from the nearest or all the speakers (depending on assistants presets).  

Choose the corresponding device type(s) from the dropdown menu.
