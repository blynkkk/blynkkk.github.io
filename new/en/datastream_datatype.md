### Datastream: Data Type

Every Datastream has a Data Type setting. Data Type is used to specify the type and format of the data and optimize data storage and further calculations.

Make sure you choose a correct Data Type for your data. Currently, these Data Types are supported: 

|      Type      |             Min             |              Max             |
|:--------------:|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| ```Integer```  |       -2,147,483,648        |         2,147,483,647        |
|   ```Double```  |       -1.8 x 10^300         |         4.9 x 10^-324        |
|  ```String```  | any value is accepted                                      |


**IMPORTANT:**

Blynk server will ignore values that don't match the Data Type

Example: if Datastream has Data Type set to ```Integer```, but Hardware sends ```123.45```, this value will be skipped because it is ```Double```, not ```Integer```.

If the incoming value goes out of range of Min or Max setting, this value will be "cropped" to match this setting.
