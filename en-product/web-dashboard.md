# Web Dashboard
It's designed to group and visualize data of selected Datastreams in Widgets (interface modules). 
Each of them performs a specific input/output function when communicating with the hardware.
There are 5 types of Widgets:
  * [Slider](web-dashboard/dashboard-slider.md)
  * [Switch](web-dashboard/dashboard-switch.md)
  * [Label](web-dashboard/dashboard-label.md)
  * [Chart](web-dashboard/dashboard-chart.md)
  * [Map](web-dashboard/dashboard-map.md)
