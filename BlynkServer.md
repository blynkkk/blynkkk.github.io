## Why do I need Local Blynk Server?

- Better security. You are the only one who knows about the server. You can setup security policies tied to your specific needs (MAC, IPs, login names, etc). You can also make it accessible only within your private network.
- Better stability. No need to rely on 3rd party Cloud solution. You have the full control.
- Lower latency. Server is as close to you as it could be. 
- Maximum privacy. All data is stored locally and is not shared with anyone.
